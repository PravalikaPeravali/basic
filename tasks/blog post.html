<h1><b>Horsely Hills</b></h1>
<p>Horsley Hills or<u> Horsleykonda or Yenugulla Mallamma Konda</u> is a series of hills in <b>Andhra Pradesh in Madanapalle Taluka of Annamayya district</b> and is about 9 miles from Madanapalle town. <mark>The local name of the hill was Yenugu Mallama Konda after a legend of a saintly old woman named Mallamma who lived at the top of the hill</mark> and was fed by elephants (yenugulu). W.D. Horsley, a British collector, built his home around 1870 after whom it is named. In contrast to the dry and hot surrounding, this area is well vegetated with cooler climate. This made it attractive as a hill station and a tourist spot.
    The native vegetation of the area has been replaced in <i>some parts with dense growths of eucalyptus and plantations of exotic trees</i>. In the past the area had more wildlife including Sambar deer (now reintroduced into the wild), wild boar and sloth bear. More than 133 species of birds have been recorded from the area and these include the endemic Yellow-throated bulbul, first recorded from the area in 1908. Other birds which are rare in the surrounding region include the black eagle and the white-rumped shama. The endemic toad Duttaphrynus hololius has been found here and a ground orchid Diplocentrum recurvum was rediscovered here after nearly a century. Several species of lichen have also been documented from the region.
